### Signing Disclaimer
All the download files are not signed yet, because i don't know how to sign them with electron in all OSes, so, you have to trust and install the application anyway. This is a free and open-source application, if you have any suspicion, just check the code :grin:

#### Compatibilty
- Windows
  - 10 (tested)
  - Versions under windows 10 are not tested yet, but should work as well.
- Linux
  - Snap and Debian packages (I personally recommend using debian packages over snap, classic confinement it's sometimes buggy).
  - Ubuntu
    - 19.\* (tested) - working
    - 16.\* (not tested yet)
    - Should work on any distro based on ubuntu too.
  - Another distros not tested, but there is a rpm package in releases. Should work on all distros with app indicators.
